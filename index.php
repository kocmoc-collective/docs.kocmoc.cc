        <div class="entry-content">

            <p>It is the mission of KOCMOC Freeform Radio to provide diverse and innovative online broadcasting that reflects the interests and concerns of the community; thus, creating broad cultural experiences via a number of specially made works, conceptual mixtapes, conversations, DJ sets, documentaries, visuals and other media. Our vision is self-indulgent and non-commercial forms of music spread around so creativity is enriched.</p>

            <p>A self-funded small group of programmers, producers, photographers and graphic designers have made up the KOCMOC team throughout the project's development. They have worked together to support one another while expanding the network and the music community. The station consists of members who perform both DJ shifts and administrative functions.</p>

            <p>Kocmoc Collective is funded by its own members and also its listeners’ – supporters’ donations. We do not accept advertising or underwriting. Kocmoc Collective uses its funding to cover servers costs, to purchase and repair equipment and to expand its music library.</p>

            <p>KOCMOC aspires to transform into a multi-cultural physical environment where people with different backgrounds can come together to share their creative expressions and build a stronger community.</p>
