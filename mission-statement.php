            <h2>Our vision is self-indulgent and non-commercial forms of music spread around so creativity is enriched.</h2>

            <p>It is the mission of KOCMOC Freeform Radio to provide diverse and innovative online broadcasting that reflects the interests and concerns of the community; thus, creating broad cultural experiences via a number of specially made works, conceptual mixtapes, conversations, DJ sets, documentaries, visuals and other media.</p>

            <p>A self-funded small group of programmers, designers, photographers and producers have made up the KOCMOC team throughout the project's development. They have worked together to support one another while expanding the network and the music community. The station consists of members who perform both DJ shifts and administrative functions.</p>
