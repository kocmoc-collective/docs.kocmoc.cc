            <h2>Guidelines for submitting radio shows</h2>

            <p>Please submit recordings and any photos or videos you wish to accompany with your set digitally via <a href="https://forms.gle/LuEQfc2KJUYZX1oY6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Submitting Shows Form</a>, in which you should include all the associated details of your set, such as the title, description, tracklist, tags, etc.</p>

            <p>For simple, private file sharing we recommend <a href="https://send.vis.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Send</a>, which lets you share files with end-to-end encryption.</p>

            <p>The deadline for submitting radio shows weekly is Saturday at 00:00 EET/EEST (local time in Greece), so that we can process and schedule the radio shows on time.</p>

            <p>Please ensure that all submitted material remains available online at least for 3 days.</p>

            <p>Late submissions and / or broken links will result in the radio show being rescheduled.</p>

            <p>We kindly request that any material you submit is your original content.</p>
